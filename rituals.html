  <h2>Yakshganam</h2>
  <p>
     One of the most important folk theatres of Karnataka and Kasaragod yakhaganam has carved a unique niche for these two places in the cultural map of India. No wonder why the villages are replete with eminent yakshagana artistes for it is the most cherished cultural possession of these people. To the villagers this art form is as close to them as their mother tongue. Most of the stories in yakshagana are drawn from the epics like Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavatha and other mythological episodes. Though it is generally described as folk art it has strong classical connections.
 </p>
<p>
   The name yakshagana suggests the music of celestial beings. Originally yakshagana was known by different names to different people. For instance Bayatala is a name for yakshagana familiar to some people in Karnataka. In kannada bayatala denotes an art form presented in the open air. The Terukkuthu of Tamilnadu, Kootiyatam and Chakyarkuttu of Kerala, Veedhinataka of Andhra Pradesh can be considered as sister art forms.
</p>
<p>
    Yakshagana is a musical dance drama. Singing and drumming merge with dancing, and words with gestural interpretation, and players clad in costumes of striking colour and contours are parts of the dance form. In Yakshagana music and speech go hand in hand and both could reach a good distance without our modern sound system. It is believed that the art form of yakshagana was originated in South Canara District of Karnataka and Kasaragod District of Kerala. Parthisubha one of the pioneers of yakshagana hails from kasaragod district. In India almost all the art forms, in one way or the other, are related to the worship of god. These art forms help to inculcate the religious, cultural and ethical values in the minds of the people. Yakshagana is believed to have evolved from the ancient Bhutha-worship prevalent in South Canara and Kasaragod. Theyyam is also a manifestation of this Bhutha worship. But it is evident from the performance that Yakshagana is also influenced by the folk dance and Sanskrit drama. Bharatha’s Natyashasthra also has had its influence on this art form.

The bride dressed in all finery, covered with gold ornaments and her palms and feet adorned with an intricately woven pattern of mylanchi (henna), sits amidst the circle of dancers on a high seat called the peetam. While the dancers sing they clap their hands rhythmically and move around the bride in simple steps. Two or three girls will begin the song and soon the rest of the team joins in chorus. The dance goes far into the night. Sometimes a type of Oppana called Oppana Chayal is performed that does not involve the clapping of hands. The other type of Oppana is Oppana Murukkam.
