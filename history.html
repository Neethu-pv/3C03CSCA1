 <h1> History Of Kasargod</h1>
 <p>
    <b>Kasaragod</b> was known to the Arabs by the name <i>Harkwillia</i>. Many Arab travelers visiting Kerala between the 9<sup>th</sup> and the 14<sup>th</sup> centuries visited Kasaragod, being an important trade centre then. Duarte Borbosa, a Portuguese traveler who visited Kumbla, near Kasaragod in <big>1514</big> recorded that rice being exported for coir to Maldives.

<p>
  Kasaragod was part of the Kumbala Kingdom with 64 Malayalam and Tulu villages. The Vijayanagara empire attacked and annexed Kasaragod from the Kolathiri Raja with Nileshwaram as one of the capital. During the decline of the Vijayanagara empire, the administration of this area was vested with Ikkeri Nayakas. At the onset of collapse of the Vijayanagara empire, Venkappa Nayaka declared independence to Ikkery. Kumbla, Chandragiri and Bekal are considered to be the chain of forts constructed or renovated by Shivappa Nayaka.

    Francis Buccanan, the family doctor of <i>Arthur Wellesley</i>, visited Kasargod in <big>1800</big>.In his travelogue, he recorded information on places like <i>Athiraparambu, Kavvai, Nileshwaram, Bekal, Chandragiri</i> and<i> Manjeshwar. Hosdurg </i>and<i> Vellarikundu</i> is part of <b>Kolathunadu</b> (south of Chandragiri river) and <i>Kasaragod</i> and <i>Manjeshwaram</i> is in the <b>Tulunadu region</b> (north of Chandragiri river). In <big>1763</big>, Hyder Ali conquered Bedanoor (Bidnur), the capital of the Ikkery Naiks. His son Tippu Sultan conquered much of Malabar. As per the <i>Sreerangapattanam</i> Treaty of <big>1792</big>, Tippu surrendered Malabar, except Kanara to the British. The British occupied Kanara only after the death of Tippu Sultan. It is said that Kinavoor Molom (Sree Dharma Shashtha Temple)is belonging to Karinthalam (one of 64 Brahmin villages in old Kerala).

<p>
Before the formation of Kerala, Kasaragod was a part of South Canara district of erstwhile Madras Presidency. Kasaragod became part of Kannur district following the reorganisation of states and formation of Kerala in <big>1<sup>st</sup> November 1956</big>. <b>Kasaragod</b> was declared a district in the year<b> 1984</b>. Inclusion of Kasargod with Kerala has been a contentious issue as there is a sizeable population which speaks Kannada and Tulu. But it is noted that as per <big>2011</big> census report only 4.2% people in the district speak Kannada as their mother tongue.
